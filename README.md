# image-Source-Reverb

This Matlab code creates an impulse response based on image source modelling within a simulated space and between simulated listener and source positions.  An audio file can be loaded into the code and convolved with the impulse response in order to simulate the audio as the source in the model.

## Getting Started

Open and run the code in Matlab, the dry audio signal will play and then the convolved audio signal will play afterwards.

### Prerequisites

Make sure all files in this repository are located in the chosen Matlab directory.  Any future audio files must be kept in this same directory as well.

## Running the tests

Change the values in the "parameters" area in order to experiment with different reverbs using this model.
  
## Versioning

### Current Concerns/Issues

* A version using a GUI is currently being implemented for easier use.
